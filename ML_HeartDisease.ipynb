I have tried to study Machine Learning by myself and implemented a small project to crystallise my knowledge. I have chosen a Kaggle dataset - [Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/c/heart-disease/overview) to practice my knowledge on Machine Learning.\n",

Hence, this is a [binary classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification) problem.

        "### Conclusion\n",
        "- Using AUC Score, Random Forest provides the best classification accuracy.\n",
        "- XGBoost which is known for providing very good perfomance was fractionally lower than Random Forest.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Further Work\n",
        "\n",
        "- Feature engineering could be investigated (e.g. PCA to remove redundant features) to try and obtain better accuracy.\n",
        "- A very popular technique for increasing accuracy especially in Kaggle competitions is ensembling. A good link is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python).\n",
        "- In order to further strengthen our conclusions, we should obtain more data to further test our algorithms and see if the same conclusion holds.."

        "There are some terms, which are very common in Machine Learning literature and a brief explanation is provided:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Supervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning): There are input variables (x) and an output variable (y). We need to find an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.\n",
        "- [Unsupervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning): There is only input data (x) and no corresponding output variable (y). The aim is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.\n",
        "- [Cross Validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html): It's a technique where the data is split into several parts. We tune our model on some parts of the data. We test the model's performance on the data which was kept aside. For a detailed explanation, please refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/cross-validation.html)\n",
        "- [Log Loss (logistic loss/cross-entropy loss)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html) - A performance metric used to evaluate the probability outputs of a classifier as opposed to its predictions.\n",
        "- [Accuracy](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html) - A performance measure which determines the percentage of samples the algorithm was able to classify correctly.\n",
        "- [Perfomance Measures (precision, recall, f1-score) ](https://blog.exsilio.com/all/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures/) - Some other measures which help us determine the quality of the algorithm's perfomance.\n",
        "- [ROC Curves for Binary Classification](https://machinelearningmastery.com/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-classification-in-python/) - Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are an important classification metric, especially for binary classification. For deep learning models, please check this [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-calculate-precision-recall-f1-and-more-for-deep-learning-models/).\n"
